These are a few projects completed by teams in a laboratory at RWTH
 University. The most recent project was a self-selected endeavor where we
 developed a production line using LEGO components and programmed software.
 This project involved integrating a color sensor, two buttons, and three
 motors. Its purpose was to effectively sort pieces into their appropriate containers.

The features of the project include:

- An emergency button that halts the software immediately.
- A start/stop button that allows pausing and resuming the production line
 without terminating the software.
- A motor responsible for rotating the production line.
- A motor for pushing pieces from the production line into the correct container.
- Another motor for turning three different containers to the correct
 position, aligning with the area where the pushing motor deposits the
 pieces.

The project was successfully completed.

It has the potential for enhancement by incorporating a user interface (UI)
 for efficient counting,graphical output and comprehensive control.
